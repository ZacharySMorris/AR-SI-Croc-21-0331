# CrocodylianLateralSkullOntogeny
This repository contains the data and R code used to perform the landmarking and analysis of crocodylian lateral skull ontogeny for [Morris et al., 2021]. The raw and procrustes aligned landmark data (for complete skull, snout profile curve only, and skull table curve only), matrices for designating sliding semi-landmarks, and specimen covariate data can all be found within the [data folder](data). The necessary code to [load data](Setup.R) and perform analyses can be found within the [R folder](R).
